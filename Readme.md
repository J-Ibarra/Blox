# Blox - A 3D Platformer game made with SilenceEngine

Blox is a 3D Platformer game made using [SilenceEngine](https://github.com/sriharshachilakapati/SilenceEngine/), a 2D/3D game engine written on top of LWJGL 3. This game is in heavy development, and will be updated daily. Unlike the 2D demo of SilenceEngine ScorpionHunter, this is going to be a complete game.
